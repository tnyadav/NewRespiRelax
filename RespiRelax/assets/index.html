			BreathRelax : Master your Stress .<br />
			<br />
			With only 3 exercises per day for 6 breaths per minute during 5 minutes.<br />
			<br />
			Based on many years of scientific research and the Yogic BreathRelax application was developed to provide a simple and efficient method against the leading cause of disease in the world means : Stress .<br />
			<br />
			One of the basic elements of Hatha Yoga breathing is called Prana. An Indian proverb tells about it : &quot; breathing well, is living well .&quot;<br />
			<br />
			In the scientific side , medical research on neurocardiaology give evidence that Brain and Heart beat in unison . If our mind and emotions affect the heart rate , heart rate also has an impact on our brain. In case of stress when the pressure is too high it interferes negatively our cardiac and respiratory rates.<br />
			<br />
			Heart and Brain therefore have their own resonant frequency, called cardiac coherence and syncs around 0.1 Hz. This cardiac coherence is reaching its optimal between 4-7 complete breaths per minute .<br />
			<br />
			It is from these findings that we sought to achieve a simple application, available at every moment and able to help you regain self control on stress , fear or anxiety events. The goal is to find a state of calm within only 5 minutes.<br />
			<br />
			To help you find your optimal frequency, settings are editable in BreathRelax . In adjusting the number of breathing will help you find your ideal frequency synchronization. At the beginning we advice you to use the default settings.<br />
			<br />

			- De-stressing : expiration longer than inspiration 60%&nbsp; / 40%<br />
			- Energizing : inspiration longer than the expiration of 40% / 60%<br />

			To start the exercise&nbsp;:<br />
			- Press the triangle, then synchronize your breathing on the bubble which rises and falls. When it rises inhale, exhale when it drops .<br />
			Beware if you have trouble to sync it does not matter , extend the period, if you can.<br />
			In all cases you should not force, breathe quietly. Eventually change the settings so you feel comfortable.<br />

			Technique to help you breathe correctly.<br />
			To inhale<br />
			1 / Inspire and start inflating the stomach to lower the diaphragm to facilitate the opening of the ribcage.<br />
			2 / Then open up your chest and gently push the ribs to the sides .<br />
			3 / Finally open up the rib cage pushing slightly upwards to below the clavicles .<br />
			To exhale<br />
			1 / Exhale deep gently by opening the&nbsp; mouth slightly .<br />
			2/ Go back up the diaphragm, by growing hollow your stomach. This will naturally bring your ribs and clavicles back to their normal position.<br />
